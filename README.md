# mindfull

A watchOS app for mental health. If the user's heartrate is below a certain value, a haptic feedback pattern will play to help them breathe (4 seconds in through nose, 6 seconds out of mouth - see heart rate variability training, resonance breathing).

If the user succeeds in activating their parasympathetic nervous system, a success feedback is given. This occurs three times, after which the app does nothing.
